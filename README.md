# Pacmen

## Description

Factory for making pacmen
You are given a starter.html code.
When button "make one" is pressed you need to complete the code 
to position the new pacman image and add it to the "game" div. It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.
You also need to make each pacman bounce off any wall it hits. 
Start by getting at least one pacman positioned and viewable.

NOTE

This was a little project that I had in my MITxPRO course.  

You can see it at https://tschanzvera.github.io/PacMen-Exercise/starter.html

## How to run

Load the url in your browser, click the button " Add PacMan" to make a pacman, and the button "start game" to make it move

## Roadmap of future improvements 

It would be fun if the PacMen would change color when they hit the wall
