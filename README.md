# PacMen-Exercise

## Description

Factory for making pacmen.
I was given a starter.html code that I had to modify.
When button "make one" is clicked a pacman is added.
When the button "start game" is clicked the pacMen start to move.
I had to position the new pacman image and add it to the "game" div. It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.
I also needed to make each pacman bounce off any wall it hits. I made the pacMen different sizes and also made them turn when they bounced off the wall.

NOTE

This was a little project that I had in my MITxPRO course.  

You can see it at https://tschanzvera.github.io/PacMen-Exercise/index.html

## How to run

Load the url in your browser, click the button " Add PacMan" to make a pacman, and the button "start game" to make it move

## Roadmap of future improvements 

I would like to make the PacMen change color everytime they hit the wall.
